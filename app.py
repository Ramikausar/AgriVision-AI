DISEASE_CAUSES = {
    "rot": "Rot is typically caused by fungal or bacterial pathogens that thrive in overly moist conditions. Poor drainage, overwatering, and high humidity create the perfect environment for rot-causing organisms to infect the plant through wounds or natural openings.",
    "blight": "Blight is caused by pathogenic fungi or bacteria (such as Phytophthora or Alternaria) that spread through water splashes, wind, or contaminated soil. It often starts in cool, wet weather and can survive in plant debris between seasons.",
    "spot": "Leaf spots are caused by fungal or bacterial pathogens that spread through water splashes, wind-blown rain, or contaminated gardening tools. They typically enter through stomata or small wounds and thrive in humid conditions with poor air circulation.",
    "mildew": "Powdery mildew is caused by fungal spores (Erysiphales family) that thrive in moderate temperatures with high humidity but dry leaf surfaces. Spores spread through wind and typically attack when there's poor air circulation and low light.",
    "rust": "Rust is caused by fungal pathogens (Pucciniales order) that require living plant tissue to survive. Spores spread through wind, water, or direct contact, and thrive in moderate temperatures with extended leaf wetness periods.",
    "wilt": "Wilting is often caused by soil-borne fungi (Fusarium or Verticillium) that invade the plant's vascular system, blocking water transport. It can persist in soil for years and enters through root wounds.",
    "mosaic": "Mosaic patterns are caused by plant viruses that are typically transmitted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, whiteflies, or through contaminated tools. Once infected, the plant remains a carrier.",
    "canker": "Cankers are caused by fungal or bacterial pathogens that enter through wounds in bark or stems. Stress factors like drought, frost damage, or poor nutrition make plants more susceptible.",
    "scorch": "Leaf scorch is caused by fungal pathogens or environmental stress (excessive sun, wind, or salt buildup). Fungal scorch spreads through water splash and infected plant debris, while physiological scorch results from root damage or underwatering.",
    "scab": "Scab is caused by fungal pathogens (such as Venturia inaequalis for apples) that infect young leaves and fruit during wet spring weather. Spores spread through rain splash and wind.",
    "mold": "Leaf mold is caused by fungal pathogens (such as Passalora fulva for tomatoes) that thrive in high humidity and poor air circulation. Spores enter through leaf stomata and spread rapidly in damp, shaded conditions.",
    "mite": "Spider mites are not a disease but tiny arachnid pests that feed on plant sap. They thrive in hot, dry conditions and multiply rapidly, causing stippling, yellowing, and fine webbing on leaves.",
    "virus": "Plant viruses are microscopic pathogens that hijack plant cells to replicate. They are typically transmitted by sap-sucking insects (aphids, whiteflies, leafhoppers), through contaminated tools, or via infected seeds.",
    "curl": "Leaf curl is caused by viral infections (such as Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus) transmitted by whiteflies, or by fungal pathogens (Taphrina deformans) that infect buds during cool, wet weather.",
    "default": "This disease is caused by pathogenic microorganisms (fungi, bacteria, or viruses) that infect the plant under favorable environmental conditions. Factors like high humidity, poor air circulation, overwatering, and contaminated soil or tools contribute to disease development."
}

DISEASE_PREVENTION = {
    "rot": "Prevent rot by ensuring well-draining soil and avoiding overwatering. Space plants properly for airflow, water at the base rather than overhead, and remove any decaying plant matter promptly. Use raised beds if drainage is poor.",
    "blight": "Prevent blight by using disease-resistant varieties, practicing crop rotation (avoid planting same family for 3-4 years), watering at soil level, and providing adequate plant spacing. Remove and destroy infected plant debris at season end.",
    "spot": "Prevent leaf spots by watering at the base to keep foliage dry, providing good air circulation through proper spacing, and mulching to prevent soil splash. Use clean, disease-free seeds and practice crop rotation.",
    "mildew": "Prevent powdery mildew by choosing resistant varieties, planting in full sun with good airflow, avoiding overhead watering, and applying preventive sulfur or neem oil sprays during high-risk periods.",
    "rust": "Prevent rust by planting resistant varieties, ensuring good air circulation, watering at soil level, and removing alternate host plants nearby. Clean up all plant debris in fall to reduce overwintering spores.",
    "wilt": "Prevent wilting diseases by using disease-resistant varieties, practicing long crop rotations (5-7 years), solarizing soil in hot seasons, and avoiding overwatering. Sterilize pruning tools between uses.",
    "mosaic": "Prevent mosaic viruses by controlling aphid and whitefly populations with reflective mulches or insecticidal soaps, using virus-free seeds, and regularly disinfecting gardening tools.",
    "canker": "Prevent cankers by avoiding wounding the bark, pruning during dry weather, providing proper nutrition and irrigation to reduce stress, and applying protective wound dressings on large cuts.",
    "scorch": "Prevent leaf scorch by providing consistent soil moisture through mulching and regular watering, avoiding direct afternoon sun for sensitive plants, and ensuring good air circulation. Remove and dispose of infected leaves in fall.",
    "scab": "Prevent scab by planting resistant varieties, applying preventive fungicides at green tip through petal fall, and raking up all fallen leaves and fruit in autumn to reduce overwintering spores.",
    "mold": "Prevent leaf mold by spacing plants for maximum airflow, watering at soil level, and avoiding overhead irrigation. Prune lower branches to improve air circulation around the soil line.",
    "mite": "Prevent spider mites by keeping plants well-watered to reduce stress, misting leaves regularly to increase humidity, and encouraging natural predators like ladybugs and predatory mites.",
    "virus": "Prevent viral diseases by controlling insect vectors with reflective mulches or insecticidal soaps, using virus-free certified seeds, disinfecting pruning tools between plants, and removing weeds that act as virus reservoirs.",
    "curl": "Prevent leaf curl by controlling whitefly populations with yellow sticky traps or insecticidal soaps, using reflective mulch to deter vectors, and removing infected plants promptly.",
    "default": "Prevent diseases by maintaining good garden hygiene: use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, ensure proper spacing for air circulation, water at soil level, and disinfect tools regularly."
